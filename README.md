# CLEAN MVP-ARCHITECTURE FOR ANDROID
Hello, it's a simple clear MVP project without any MVP - frameworks (Mosby, Moxy etc.).

##Stack of technologies:
- [MVP] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter);
- [Kotlin] (https://kotlinlang.org/);
- [Retrofit2] (http://square.github.io/retrofit/);
- [GSON] (https://github.com/google/gson);
- [ButterKnife] (http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/);
- [kapt-annotation-processing-for-kotlin] (https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2015/05/kapt-annotation-processing-for-kotlin).

##For what?
I decided to write a small project that uses a clean MVP architecture, without the use of a variety of frameworks. First of all, this project is written for self-development and as an example for colleagues. 

##What will it do?
I have a project for AWT Bavaria. From there it was taken three news screen that will be written by MVP pattern.

So I decided to use the language - Kotlin.

Currently implemented first commit to one screen. In the future, the project will develop
